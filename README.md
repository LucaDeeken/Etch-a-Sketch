# Etch-a-Sketch

Exercise from "The Odin Project". 
I created most of the HTML containers & CSS data within the script itself, intentionally making it more challenging. 
This approach might not be the easiest to read, but it's been a great way for me to practice manipulating the DOM directly through the script.
